# Hi there, I'm Saad Fathy! 👋

I'm a passionate Backend Developer Learner focused on building scalable, reliable systems with Python. Currently, I’m sharpening my skills in backend foundations — APIs, databases, and system design — while exploring tools like Docker, Git, and cloud platforms.

My background as a mechanical engineer trained me to approach challenges with structure and persistence. I enjoy breaking down complex systems into simple, logical solutions, and I believe in steady growth:
💡 “slow but steady wins the race.”

- 🌱 Currently enrolled in the **ProDev Backend Program** with ALX, where I’m building strong foundations in Python, APIs, databases, and backend systems.  
- 🔭 Working on: personal backend projects
- 🌍 Languages: Arabic (native), English (Intermediate)
